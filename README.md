<h1 align="center">Two Truths, One Lie: A GitHub Talk</h1>

<p align="center">
Welcome to the official repository for the Aston Computer Science Society's live GitHub collaboration event!
</p>

👋 **Welcome!**
This repository is part of a live, interactive session designed to teach you the basics of the GitHub workflow. By participating, you'll make your first-ever Pull Request and join our room-wide game of "Two Truths, One Lie."

**Let's get started!**

🚀 **Your Mission: How to Play**
Follow these five steps to get your name on the board. All of this is done directly on the GitHub website—no extra software needed!

**Fork the Repository**

Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of this page. This will create your own personal copy of the project.

**Edit the PLAYERS.md File**

In your new forked copy, you'll see a list of files. Find and click on PLAYERS.md.

Click the pencil icon ✏️ to start editing the file.

**Add Your Entry**

You'll see a template inside the file. Copy the entire template section.

Paste it at the bottom of the file and replace the placeholders with your name and your two truths and one lie.

**Propose Your Changes**

Once you're done, scroll to the bottom of the page. You'll see a green button that says Propose changes. Click it to save your work.

**Create the Pull Request!**

This is the final step! On the next page, click the green Create pull request button. This submits your entry to the main project.

🤔 **What Happens Next?**
Once your Pull Request is submitted, you're officially in the game!

Keep an eye on the main presentation screen. We'll be showing the incoming Pull Requests live. When we call out your name, be ready to stand up, introduce yourself, and share your "Two Truths, One Lie" with the room!
